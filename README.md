	• Objective
		○ Slice and dice data based on wage quartile, age, and education
		○ Atlanta Fed's wage tracker uses moving averages and medians (?), we want to be able to view averages 
	• Data source
		○ CADRE - Current Population Survey (kansascityfed.org)
		○ Harmonized Variable and Longitudinally Matched [Atlanta Federal Reserve] (1976-Present)
	• Important information
		○ Includes only data for 16+ year olds
		○ Each variable's start year is indicated at the end of the variable name
			§ For example, mlr76 is coded with consistent values (1 = employed, 2 = unemployed, 3 = not in labor force) from 1976 until today
		○ For many variables, lags are provided
			§ For example, mlr76_tm12 is the individual's labor force status from 12 months ago
